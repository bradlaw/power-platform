Power Virtual Agents is available as an app within Microsoft Teams, which means you can easily create your own chatbots that answer questions posed by other employees or team members.

You can add the Power Virtual Agents app from the Microsoft Teams app store and begin to create, author, test, and publish your bot directly into teams, all within the Microsoft Teams interface. You can also visit [https://aka.ms/PVAForTeams](https://aka.ms/PVAForTeams) to directly install or open the app.

Because Power Virtual Agents is fully integrated as an app, you can apply Teams settings, such as high contrast and dark mode [under Teams **Settings**](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-settings-in-teams-b506e8f1-1a96-4cf1-8c6b-b6ed4f424bc7#bkmk_howdoienablehighcontrastmode).

Some of the scenarios where you might want to create a Power Virtual Agents chatbot in Microsoft Teams include:

- Someone in the payroll department creates a chatbot that helps teammates get tax filing forms and information
- The facilities manager creates a chatbot that answers the common questions they are receiving about coming back to work after a pandemic.
- A human resources (HR) employee creates a bot that can answer questions about vacation balance, time off, and benefits.
- A member of the finance department creates a chatbot that helps their teammates in the finance team to fill out expense reports

The Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams makes it easy to fulfill any scenario, especially those that arise within an organization. If you're looking to create a chatbot you can share externally, such as one that interacts with customers outside your organization, see the [Power Virtual Agents web app version of this topic](../fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents-portal.md).
